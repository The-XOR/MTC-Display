To calculate the current measure in 7/8 time from MIDI clock, divide the total number of MIDI clock pulses by 24 (pulses per quarter note) 
to get the number of beats, and then divide that by 7 (beats per measure) to find the measure number. 
The current measure is found by taking the result modulo 1 and adding 1, or simply rounding the result up.
- Here's the calculation step-by-step:
    1 Get the total beats elapsed:
        A MIDI clock sends 24 pulses per quarter note.
        A quarter note is a single beat in 7/4 time, but in 7/8 time, a beat is an eighth note.
        An eighth note is half the length of a quarter note.T
        Therefore, there are 2 eighth notes per quarter note.
        Total beats = (Total MIDI clock pulses) / 24 * 2
        
    2 Get the total measures elapsed:
        A measure in 7/8 time has 7 eighth-note beats.
        Total measures = (Total beats) / 7
        
    3 Calculate the current measure:
        The current measure is the remainder after dividing the total measures by the total number of measures in the song.
        Current measure = (Total measures) modulo 1
        If the total measures are not an integer, add 1 to the decimal to get the current measure. For example, if the result 
        is 3.2, the current measure is 4.
        
- Example:
    Let's say the total MIDI clock pulses are 300.
    1) Total beats: (300 / 24) * 2 = 12.5 * 2 = 25 beats.
    2) Total measures: 25 / 7 = 3.57 
    3) Current measure: Since 3.57 is greater than 3, the song is in the 4th measure.
    Therefore, if the total MIDI clock pulses are 300, the current measure is 4.
